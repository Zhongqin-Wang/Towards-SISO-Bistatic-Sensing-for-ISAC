# 🚀 Towards SISO Bistatic Sensing for ISAC
Clock asynchrony in bistatic sensing remains a major challenge, as independently clocked and spatially separated transceivers introduce random phase offsets in the Channel State Information (CSI), which must be compensated for accurate sensing. This work presents WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) sensing framework that enables accurate delay-Doppler estimation from distorted CSI, requiring only a single antenna at both transmitter and receiver. A self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method is proposed for random phase removal by constructing a reference signal from the original CSI, followed by a delay-domain beamforming for interference suppression and beamformed Doppler Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for unambiguous motion extraction. Our experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate delay-Doppler parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of prior multi-antenna methods. Based on the extracted robust features, even when using compact neural networks such as the embedded-friendly MobileViT XXS with only 1.3 million parameters, WiDFS 3.0 achieves strong robustness and generalization capability. It consistently outperforms commonly- used features such as CSI amplitude, raw mirrored Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler, as validated on extensive single- and multi-target activity datasets.
